# Development Practices

## Versioning Convention

This project adheres to Semantic Versioning (SemVer) using the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format:

*   **`MAJOR` (e.g., 1.0.0 → 2.0.0):** For incompatible API changes or very significant new features, architectural reworks, or paradigm shifts.
*   **`MINOR` (e.g., 0.1.0 → 0.2.0):** For adding new functionality in a backward-compatible manner. This includes new features, significant enhancements to existing features, or new screens/modules.
*   **`PATCH` (e.g., 0.1.0 → 0.1.1):** For backward-compatible bug fixes, minor UI tweaks, performance improvements, or documentation updates that don't add new features.

### Version History (Conceptual)

*   **0.1.0:** Initial MVP release.
*   **0.1.1 (Current Target):** UI refinements (Settings page backgrounds, forced dark mode).
*   **0.2.0 (Next Major Feature Set):** Alignment streak, enhanced Progress Tab, full Personal Code editing on Align page, Collect page UI parity with Align page, drag/copy between Personal Code and Insights, customizable notifications.

Subsequent versions will follow this pattern.
