## 2025-05-27: Pivot to "NeuroPaths - Neural Constellation" Concept

**Decision:**
The project will pivot from the "HorizonFrame" concept (a daily alignment journal) to a new concept named "NeuroPaths." The core theme will be "Neural Constellation."

**Context & Problem:**
The HorizonFrame concept, while sound, was perceived to have limited market differentiation and potential for viral engagement. A more compelling and visually unique direction was sought to align with current trends in mental wellness, neuroplasticity, and personalized digital experiences.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1.  **Continue with HorizonFrame:** Refine existing features and marketing.
2.  **Minor Theme Adjustment for HorizonFrame:** Keep core functionality but explore different UI themes (e.g., "Zen Garden," "Mindful Explorer").
3.  **Radical Pivot (Selected):** Develop a new core mechanic and theme (NeuroPaths).

**Reasoning for Decision:**
*   **Stronger Unique Value Proposition:** "NeuroPaths" offers a distinct approach by focusing on actively "rewiring" emotional responses and visualizing this internal journey as a personal "Neural Constellation." This is more tangible and engaging than a general alignment journal.
*   **Visual Appeal & Marketability:** The "Neural Constellation" theme lends itself to stunning, shareable visuals, which is advantageous for marketing on platforms like Instagram and TikTok.
*   **Alignment with Scientific Interest:** The concept taps into growing public interest in neuroplasticity and emotional intelligence.
*   **User Engagement Potential:** The idea of building and evolving a personal constellation offers a compelling long-term engagement loop.

**Consequences & Impact:**
*   **Documentation Overhaul:** Significant updates required for `Roadmap.md`, `UI_Theme_Exploration.md`, `MarketingStrategy.md`, `README.md`, `Architecture.md`, and this `Decisions.md`. All previous documentation related to HorizonFrame will be archived within these documents for potential future reference.
*   **Development Shift:** The development roadmap will be entirely revised to focus on NeuroPaths MVP features (emotion logging, guided circuit completion, basic constellation visualization).
*   **Potential for Reversion:** The pivot is undertaken with the understanding that if the NeuroPaths concept does not prove viable, the team can revert to the archived HorizonFrame documentation and plans.

**Stakeholders Notified:**
*   N/A (Currently a solo project with AI assistance).
