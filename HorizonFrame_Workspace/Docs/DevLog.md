### 2025-05-24

**What We Did (Completed):**
*   Changed the project's folder structure to `HorizonFrame_Workspace`. This helps us use Obsidian (our documentation tool) more effectively and keep documents organized. (This change is recorded in the code history with the ID `f625d17d`).
*   Created the first versions of important documentation files, including: `CHANGELOG.md` (tracks changes), `Docs/Architecture.md` (explains how the app is built), `Docs/Decisions.md` (records important choices), `Docs/DevLog.md` (this file, for daily updates), `Docs/TASKS.md` (lists work to be done), and `README.md` (a general project overview). (Code history ID: `f625d17d`).
*   Added new documents to help team members: `Docs/Onboarding.md` (how to get started), `Docs/Daily Doc Bot.md` (about our automated documentation helper), `Docs/Main.md` (main project notes), and `Docs/Marketing.md` (notes for promoting the app). (Code history IDs: `9d4a889c`, `2be5f820`).
*   Added new detailed plans (specifications) for features: `Specs/Onboarding.md` (for the new user experience) and `Specs/Signup-Login.md` (for how users will sign up and log in). (Code history ID: `9d4a889c`).
*   Saved backups of all our documentation several times. (Code history IDs: `8014e29c`, `4f99e3dc`, `9d4a889c`).
*   Made changes to how Obsidian is set up, including removing a link to an old GitHub code storage location. (Code history ID: `2be5f820`).

**Decisions We Made:**
*   We decided to use `HorizonFrame_Workspace` as the main place for all project files and documents. This makes it easier to keep everything in sync with Obsidian and well-organized.
*   We changed our plan for how to use Obsidian. We might not use the old method of directly syncing notes with a GitHub repository that we called "Second Brain."

**Problems or Questions (Issues):**
*   A note in our code history ("Removed Second Brain") suggests we've changed how we're using Obsidian for syncing notes. We need to make sure everyone understands the new way of doing this.

**What's Next (Next Steps):**
*   Continue to add more details and improve the documents in the new `HorizonFrame_Workspace`.
*   Keep an eye on the new way Obsidian syncs our documents and write down how it works.


### 2025-05-24 - Session 2 (approx. 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM)

**What We Did (Completed):**
*   Discussed and refined the daily handoff document system (`DailyBriefing.md`, `DailyStart_LLMPrompt.md`, `DailyFinish_LLMPrompt.md`) to support multiple LLM work sessions within a single day.
*   Updated the structure of `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` to include timestamped "Session Start," "Status from Previous Session," and "Key Tasks for This Session."
*   Updated `Docs/MetaPrompts/DailyFinish_LLMPrompt.md` to guide the LLM in creating session-specific `DevLog.md` entries and preparing `DailyBriefing.md` for the *next* session.
*   Populated the current `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` (for 2025-05-24, Session starting ~11:30 AM) with tasks to commit these structural changes and then execute this "Daily Finish" routine.
*   Clarified for the user (Cole) how to use `DailyStart_LLMPrompt.md` and `DailyFinish_LLMPrompt.md` as direct scripts for LLM interaction at session boundaries.
*   Initiated the "Daily Finish" process for this work session.

**Decisions We Made:**
*   The daily handoff system will now explicitly support multiple sessions per day through timestamping and session-specific references in `DailyBriefing.md` and `DevLog.md`.
*   The user (Cole) will copy-paste the content of `Docs/MetaPrompts/DailyStart_LLMPrompt.md` and `Docs/MetaPrompts/DailyFinish_LLMPrompt.md` to the LLM to start and end sessions, respectively.

**Problems or Questions (Issues) Encountered:**
*   Continued to experience issues with `git add` via the command line not staging all expected files (specifically `README.md`, the initial `Docs/DailyBriefing.md`, and `Docs/MetaPrompts/DailyStart_LLMPrompt.md`).
*   Advised the user that committing via GitHub Desktop might be necessary for the files related to the initial handoff system setup and the subsequent multi-session adaptations. The commit message for the multi-session changes should be `"docs: adapt handoff system for multi-session days"`.

**What's Next (Next Steps) for the *next session*:**
*   **Crucial First Step:** Confirm that all documentation changes (both the initial handoff system files AND these multi-session adaptation files) have been successfully committed to Git.
*   If commits are successful, guide the user to push all changes to the `origin/main` branch on GitHub.
*   Once the documentation system is fully committed and pushed, discuss and select the next UI feature or development task for HorizonFrame.
*   Prepare a new `DailyBriefing.md` for that development task.

### 2025-05-24 - Session 3 (approx. 16:00 - 16:45)

**Key Tasks Worked On:**
*   Continued debugging swipe actions (for edit/delete) in `AlignView.swift`.
*   Created `Docs/MetaPrompts/EndOfDayProcedure_LLMPrompt.md` to standardize end-of-session documentation updates.
*   Initiated end-of-day documentation update procedure.

**Accomplishments:**
*   Systematically attempted several common SwiftUI fixes for swipe action issues in `AlignView` (ensuring `ScrollView`, simplifying `ForEach`, trying `LazyVStack`, commenting out other gestures).
*   Established a new meta-prompt (`EndOfDayProcedure_LLMPrompt.md`) to improve consistency in daily wrap-ups.

**Key Decisions Made:**
*   Decided to pause swipe action debugging in the simulator due to persistent issues and proceed with end-of-day documentation.

**Issues Encountered:**
*   **Critical:** Swipe actions in `AlignView.swift` remain non-functional in the macOS simulator. The root cause is still undetermined despite multiple attempts.

**Next Steps (for next session):**
*   Consider testing `AlignView` swipe actions on a physical iOS device to rule out simulator-specific issues.
*   If swipe actions remain problematic, investigate alternative UI/UX for edit/delete functionality in `AlignView` (e.g., context menus, explicit buttons per item).
*   Update `Docs/Roadmap.md` to reflect the status of swipe actions.
*   Prepare `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` for the next session.

### 2025-05-25

**What We Did (Completed):**
*   Updated documentation (`Docs/Daily Doc Bot.md`, `README.md`, `Docs/DailyBriefing.md`) to reflect GitHub Desktop usage for version control and to outline current UI refinement tasks.
*   Corrected the repository structure diagram in `README.md` to accurately show the location of `Models`, `ViewModels`, `Views`, and `Services` directories within the `Horizon-Frame` sub-directory.
*   Implemented UI refinements:
    *   **AlignView:** Added a 3-dots menu with a placeholder "Edit Personal Code" action.
    *   **CollectView:** Styled personal code line boxes and insight collection items to have black/transparent backgrounds; changed the "Deposit" button color to white.
    *   **SettingsView:** Ensured a consistent black background.
*   Confirmed all previous and current session changes were committed and pushed to `origin/main` via GitHub Desktop.

**Decisions We Made:**
*   Proceeded with UI tasks as outlined in the `DailyBriefing.md` after confirming previous documentation commits.
*   The `Views` directory is located at `HorizonFrame_Workspace/Horizon-Frame/Views/`, not directly under the workspace root.

**Problems or Questions (Issues):**
*   Initial file searches for View components failed because the `README.md`'s repository structure was slightly inaccurate. This was resolved by listing directory contents and then correcting `README.md`.
*   A minor duplication error occurred during the `CollectView.swift` modification for the "Deposit" button, which was subsequently corrected.

**What's Next (Next Steps):**
*   Proceed with the next development cycle, likely involving the implementation of the "Edit Personal Code" functionality in `AlignView` or other features as prioritized.
*   Continue to follow the daily handoff procedure.
