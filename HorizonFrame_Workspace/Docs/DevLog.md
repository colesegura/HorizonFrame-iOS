**What We Did (Completed):**
*   Changed the project's folder structure to `HorizonFrame_Workspace`. This helps us use Obsidian (our documentation tool) more effectively and keep documents organized. (This change is recorded in the code history with the ID `f625d17d`).
*   Created the first versions of important documentation files, including: `CHANGELOG.md` (tracks changes), `Docs/Architecture.md` (explains how the app is built), `Docs/Decisions.md` (records important choices), `Docs/DevLog.md` (this file, for daily updates), `Docs/TASKS.md` (lists work to be done), and `README.md` (a general project overview). (Code history ID: `f625d17d`).
*   Added new documents to help team members: `Docs/Onboarding.md` (how to get started), `Docs/Daily Doc Bot.md` (about our automated documentation helper), `Docs/Main.md` (main project notes), and `Docs/Marketing.md` (notes for promoting the app). (Code history IDs: `9d4a889c`, `2be5f820`).
*   Added new detailed plans (specifications) for features: `Specs/Onboarding.md` (for the new user experience) and `Specs/Signup-Login.md` (for how users will sign up and log in). (Code history ID: `9d4a889c`).
*   Saved backups of all our documentation several times. (Code history IDs: `8014e29c`, `4f99e3dc`, `9d4a889c`).
*   Made changes to how Obsidian is set up, including removing a link to an old GitHub code storage location. (Code history ID: `2be5f820`).

**Decisions We Made:**
*   We decided to use `HorizonFrame_Workspace` as the main place for all project files and documents. This makes it easier to keep everything in sync with Obsidian and well-organized.
*   We changed our plan for how to use Obsidian. We might not use the old method of directly syncing notes with a GitHub repository that we called "Second Brain."

**Problems or Questions (Issues):**
*   A note in our code history ("Removed Second Brain") suggests we've changed how we're using Obsidian for syncing notes. We need to make sure everyone understands the new way of doing this.

**What's Next (Next Steps):**
*   Continue to add more details and improve the documents in the new `HorizonFrame_Workspace`.
*   Keep an eye on the new way Obsidian syncs our documents and write down how it works.
