**Completed:**
*   Refactored project structure to `HorizonFrame_Workspace` for improved Obsidian integration
    and documentation management (Commit `f625d17d`).
*   Initialized core documentation files: `CHANGELOG.md`, `Docs/Architecture.md`,
    `Docs/Decisions.md`, `Docs/DevLog.md`, `Docs/TASKS.md`, `README.md` (Commit `f625d17d`).
*   Added new documentation: `Docs/Onboarding.md`, `Docs/Daily Doc Bot.md`, `Docs/Main.md`,
    `Docs/Marketing.md` (Commits `9d4a889c`, `2be5f820`).
*   Added new specification documents: `Specs/Onboarding.md`, `Specs/Signup-Login.md`
    (Commit `9d4a889c`).
*   Performed several vault backups (Commits `8014e29c`, `4f99e3dc`, `9d4a889c`).
*   Adjusted Obsidian configuration, including disconnecting a previous GitHub repo linkage
    (Commit `2be5f820`).

**Decisions:**
*   Adopted `HorizonFrame_Workspace` as the primary project and documentation workspace
    to enhance Obsidian synchronization and organization.
*   Revised Obsidian integration strategy, potentially moving away from direct GitHub
    repository syncing for the "Second Brain" concept.

**Issues:**
*   The "Removed Second Brain" commit suggests a potential issue or strategic shift away
    from a previously implemented Obsidian syncing method. Further clarification might be
    needed on the new approach.

**Next Steps:**
*   Continue populating and refining documentation within the new `HorizonFrame_Workspace`
    structure.
*   Monitor and document the new Obsidian syncing workflow.
