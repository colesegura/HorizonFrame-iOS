# HorizonFrame Project Roadmap

This document outlines planned features and improvements for HorizonFrame. It is a living document and will be updated as priorities evolve.

## Version 0.2.0: Core Feature Enhancements

*   **Alignment Streak & Progress:**
    *   Introduce a page displayed after completing a daily alignment, showing the current streak (consecutive days of alignment).
    *   Enhance the Progress Tab to display a calendar view or list showing which days alignment was completed, and how many times per day if multiple alignments occurred.
*   **Personal Code Editing (Align Page):**
    *   Implement full editing functionality for personal code directly from the Align page, triggered by the 3-dot menu. This includes modifying, adding, and deleting statements.
*   **Collect Page UI & Functional Parity:**
    *   Update the Personal Code display on the Collect page to visually match the Align page (grey text on black background, white "Add new line" option).
    *   Enable editing of personal code statements on the Collect page, similar to the Align page.
    *   Allow dragging personal code statements to the Insight Collection (or copying).
    *   Allow copying insights from the Insight Collection to Personal Code.
*   **Insight Collection Styling:**
    *   Ensure the Insight Collection display format (text fields, backgrounds) matches the Personal Code styling for consistency.

## Version 0.3.0: Notifications & Customization

*   **Customizable Insight Notifications:**
    *   Introduce a system to send notifications containing randomly selected insights from the user's Insight Collection.
    *   Allow users to customize notification frequency and timing (e.g., morning, evening, specific times) in the Settings page.

## Future Considerations (Post 0.3.0)

*   **Settings Page UI Revision:** A comprehensive UI overhaul for the Settings page to improve organization and user experience as more options are added.
*   **Advanced Statistics & Trends:** More detailed analytics in the Progress Tab.
*   **Cloud Sync & Backup:** Options for users to back up and sync their data.
*   **Export Options:** More robust data export formats.
