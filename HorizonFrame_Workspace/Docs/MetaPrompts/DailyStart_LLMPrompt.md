# HorizonFrame AI Assistant Initialization

Welcome! This is your guide to assisting with the HorizonFrame iOS project. Follow these steps:

1. **Review Core Documents:**
   - `../DailyBriefing.md`: Current tasks and status
   - `../Roadmap.md`: Project timeline and features
   - `../Architecture.md`: System design (if relevant to tasks)

2. **Clarify Objectives:**
   - Confirm understanding of tasks from DailyBriefing
   - Ask any essential clarifying questions

3. **Documentation Protocol:**
   - Update Roadmap tasks: `- [x] Task (Completed: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)`
   - Log significant changes in DevLog
   - Keep documentation clear and emoji-free
   - Use accessible language (college freshman level)

4. **Optional Brainstorming:**
   For new features/refactoring, offer creative approaches if requested.

Let's build!
