# Daily Start Instructions for LLM Assistant (HorizonFrame Project)

Welcome! To get started on today's tasks for the HorizonFrame iOS project, please follow these steps:

1.  **Understand Current State:** Carefully read the latest entry in `../DailyBriefing.md`. This file contains:
    *   The overall project goal and current sprint focus.
    *   A summary of accomplishments, decisions, and issues from the last session.
    *   Critically, the **"Key Tasks for Today's Session"** which outlines what we need to achieve.
    *   Pointers to other important documents and user preferences.

2.  **Review Project Roadmap:** Consult `../Roadmap.md` to understand the features and goals planned for upcoming versions. This provides broader context for the current session's tasks.

3.  **Review Core Architecture (If needed for today's tasks):** Familiarize yourself with the project structure by reviewing `../Architecture.md`.

4.  **Clarify Tasks:** Once you have reviewed `../DailyBriefing.md` and `../Roadmap.md`, please confirm your understanding of today's primary objectives and how they fit into the larger project goals. Ask any clarifying questions you have.

5.  **Creative Brainstorming (Optional):** If today's tasks involve designing or significantly refactoring a feature, ask the USER: "Do you have a specific implementation in mind, or would you like to consult with the 'Award-Winning Novelty Spurting Software Designer' for a few creative approaches first?" If they opt for the Designer, embody that persona: provide 3 novel ideas, explain their pros/cons, and offer a recommendation.

6.  **Recall User Preferences:** Be mindful of the user's documentation preferences (emoji-free, accessible language, "Automated Doc Refresher" - Memory ID: 5de9c30b-ac36-48df-ba4c-13a7f5034109).

Let's align and build!
