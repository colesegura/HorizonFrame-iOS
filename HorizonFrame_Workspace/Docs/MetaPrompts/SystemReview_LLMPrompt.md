# Meta-System Review & Optimization Prompt for LLM Assistant

**Objective:** To critically analyze the HorizonFrame project's current documentation and workflow meta-system for potential improvements in clarity, efficiency, and robustness, especially concerning human-AI collaboration.

**Persona:** Assume the role of a **"Lead Workflow Architect & AI Collaboration Strategist."** Your goal is to provide an expert, objective review.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Familiarize Yourself Thoroughly:**
    *   Carefully review the **HorizonFrame Project: Documentation & Workflow System Memory** (ID: `638b3af1-056c-4874-9536-a8756b437d25`). This is your primary source for understanding the intended system.
    *   Review the following key documents in the `Docs/` directory (and its subdirectories like `MetaPrompts/`):
        *   `WorkflowGuide.md`
        *   A recent example or template of `DailyBriefing.md` (the USER will point you to one if needed, or you can infer its structure from the Memory).
        *   `Roadmap.md`
        *   A recent example or template of `DevLog.md`
        *   `MetaPrompts/DailyStart_LLMPrompt.md`
        *   `README.md` (focus on workflow-related sections)
        *   `Architecture.md` (for context on how documentation supports technical understanding)

2.  **Analyze the System Against These Criteria:**
    *   **Clarity & Simplicity:** Is the purpose of each document clear? Is the overall workflow easy to understand and follow for both the USER and a new AI assistant?
    *   **Efficiency:** Are there any redundancies, unnecessary steps, or bottlenecks in the workflow?
    *   **Completeness & Gaps:** Are there any missing pieces in the documentation or process that could lead to confusion or errors?
    *   **Human-AI Collaboration:** How well does the system facilitate smooth handoffs and collaboration between the USER and AI assistants? Does it leverage AI capabilities effectively?
    *   **Onboarding:** How quickly could a *new* AI assistant (with access to these prompts and documents) become effective within this system?
    *   **Consistency:** Are the terminologies, processes, and expectations consistent across all documents?
    *   **Maintainability:** How easy is it to keep this meta-system itself up-to-date?

3.  **Provide Actionable Feedback:**
    *   **Identify Strengths:** What aspects of the system are well-designed and effective?
    *   **Identify Areas for Improvement:** Clearly list specific areas where the system could be enhanced.
    *   **Offer Concrete Recommendations:** For each area of improvement, propose 1-3 specific, actionable recommendations.
        *   Explain the rationale behind each recommendation.
        *   Briefly list potential pros and cons of implementing it.
    *   **Prioritize (Optional):** If possible, suggest which recommendations might offer the highest impact for the least effort.

4.  **Overall Assessment:**
    *   Provide a brief summary of your overall assessment of the system's current state and its potential.

**Output Format:** Please structure your response clearly, using headings and bullet points for readability.
