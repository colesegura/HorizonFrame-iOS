# Daily Finish Instructions for LLM Assistant (HorizonFrame Project)

Excellent work this session! To wrap up and prepare for the next one (whether later today or tomorrow), please assist with these documentation updates. These steps are part of our "Automated Doc Refresher" process:

1.  **Update `../DevLog.md`:**
    *   Prompt me for a summary of "What We Did (Completed)" in *this session*.
    *   Prompt me for any "Decisions We Made" in *this session*.
    *   Prompt me for any "Problems or Questions (Issues)" encountered in *this session*.
    *   Prompt me for preliminary thoughts on "What's Next (Next Steps)" for the *next session*.
    *   Help draft the entry. If an entry for today (YYYY-MM-DD) already exists, create a new sub-entry with a session identifier (e.g., `### YYYY-MM-DD - Session 2 (HH:MM Start)` or similar unique heading).

2.  **Update `../DailyBriefing.md` (for the *Next* Session):**
    *   **Session Start:** Update to reflect the anticipated start date and time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM) of the *next* session.
    *   **Section 2 (Status from Previous Session):** Help summarize *this just-completed session's* accomplishments, decisions, and issues. Include the end time or identifier of *this session*. Link to the new `../DevLog.md` entry/sub-entry.
    *   **Section 3 (Key Tasks for This Session):** This is crucial. Prompt me to define the specific, actionable tasks for the LLM/programmer for the *next* session (these will become "Key Tasks for This Session" when that briefing is used).
    *   **Section 5 (For the User - Cole):** Help me update my "Last thing we did (this session)" and "Focus for next personal session/next LLM session" notes.
    *   Ensure all other sections of `../DailyBriefing.md` are still relevant or updated for the *next* session's context.

3.  **Branch & Next Steps Review:**
    *   Discuss the status of the current Git branch: Is the work from *this session* complete and ready for a Pull Request, or will work continue on this branch in the next session?
    *   Briefly confirm the primary objective for the *next* session, ensuring it's clearly captured in the updated `../DailyBriefing.md` (Section 3).

4.  **Commit Changes:**
    *   Once all documentation is updated and next steps are clear, remind me to commit `../DevLog.md`, `../DailyBriefing.md`, and any other changed project files to Git.
    *   Suggest a comprehensive commit message (e.g., "docs: conclude session YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM, update handoffs").

Thank you for your help in maintaining our project's context!
