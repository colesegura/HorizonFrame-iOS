# Daily Finish Instructions for LLM Assistant (HorizonFrame Project)

Great work today! To wrap up our session and prepare for tomorrow, please assist with the following documentation updates:

1.  **Update `../DevLog.md`:**
    *   Prompt me for a summary of "What We Did (Completed)" today.
    *   Prompt me for any "Decisions We Made."
    *   Prompt me for any "Problems or Questions (Issues)" encountered.
    *   Prompt me for preliminary thoughts on "What's Next (Next Steps)."
    *   Help draft the entry for today's date (YYYY-MM-DD).

2.  **Update `../DailyBriefing.md`:**
    *   **Date:** Update to reflect the date of the *next* session.
    *   **Section 2 (Status from Last Session):** Help summarize today's accomplishments, decisions, and issues, linking to the new `../DevLog.md` entry.
    *   **Section 3 (Key Tasks for Today's Session):** This is crucial. Prompt me to define the specific, actionable tasks for the *next* LLM/programmer for the *next* session.
    *   **Section 5 (For the User - Cole):** Help me update my "Last thing we did" and "Focus for next personal session" notes.
    *   Ensure all other sections are still relevant or updated.

3.  **Commit Changes:**
    *   Once all documentation is updated, remind me to commit `../DevLog.md`, `../DailyBriefing.md`, and any other changed project files to Git.
    *   Suggest a comprehensive commit message.

Thank you for your help in maintaining our project's context!
