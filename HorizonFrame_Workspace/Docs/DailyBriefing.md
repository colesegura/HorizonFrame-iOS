# Daily Briefing - HorizonFrame

**Session Start:** 2025-05-26 09:00

---

## 1. Overall Project Goal & Current Focus

*   **Project Goal:** To build a daily alignment journal that helps users live more intentionally by reflecting on their personal code and insights.
*   **Current Sprint/Phase Goal:** With the UI refinements for Align, Collect, and Settings pages completed, the next focus is to implement core functionalities, starting with editing personal code in the Align view.

---

## 2. Status from Previous Session (2025-05-25)

*   **Key Accomplishments:**
    *   Updated documentation (`Docs/Daily Doc Bot.md`, `README.md`, `Docs/DailyBriefing.md`) to reflect GitHub Desktop usage for version control and to outline UI refinement tasks.
    *   Corrected the repository structure diagram in `README.md` to accurately show the location of `Models`, `ViewModels`, `Views`, and `Services` directories within the `Horizon-Frame` sub-directory.
    *   Implemented UI refinements:
        *   **AlignView:** Added a 3-dots menu with a placeholder "Edit Personal Code" action.
        *   **CollectView:** Styled personal code line boxes and insight collection items to have black/transparent backgrounds; changed the "Deposit" button color to white.
        *   **SettingsView:** Ensured a consistent black background.
    *   Confirmed all previous and current session changes were committed and pushed to `origin/main` via GitHub Desktop.
*   **Link to detailed DevLog entry:** [Docs/DevLog.md#2025-05-25](./DevLog.md#2025-05-25)
*   **Decisions Made:**
    *   Proceeded with UI tasks as outlined in the `DailyBriefing.md` after confirming previous documentation commits.
    *   The `Views` directory is located at `HorizonFrame_Workspace/Horizon-Frame/Views/`, not directly under the workspace root.
*   **Outstanding Issues/Blockers (Resolved from previous session):**
    *   Initial file searches for View components failed because the `README.md`'s repository structure was slightly inaccurate. (Resolved by correcting `README.md`).
    *   A minor duplication error occurred during the `CollectView.swift` modification for the "Deposit" button. (Resolved).

## 3. ðŸ”¥ Key Tasks for This Session (2025-05-26 09:00) (for LLM/Programmer) ðŸ”¥

*   **Primary Objective:** Implement the "Edit Personal Code" functionality in `AlignView.swift`.
*   **Task 1 (Align Page - Edit Functionality):**
    *   Review the existing placeholder code in `AlignView.swift` (the `Menu` and the `@State var isShowingEditSheet`).
    *   Design and implement a sheet or modal view that allows the user to edit their personal code statements. This should likely involve:
        *   Presenting the current list of personal code statements.
        *   Allowing modification of existing statements.
        *   Allowing addition of new statements.
        *   Allowing deletion of statements.
        *   Providing "Save" and "Cancel" options.
    *   Ensure changes made in the edit view are reflected in the `AppData` (e.g., `data.personalCode`) and are persisted if the app has persistence mechanisms.
*   **Task 2 (Testing):**
    *   Thoroughly test the editing functionality:
        *   Verify that existing personal code displays correctly in the edit view.
        *   Test modifying, adding, and deleting statements.
        *   Confirm changes are saved and reflected in `AlignView` and `CollectView` (if `personalCode` is shared).
        *   Test canceling edits.
*   **Task 3 (Session Wrap-up):**
    *   Commit all new code and documentation changes made during this session using GitHub Desktop.
    *   Push these changes to `origin/main` using GitHub Desktop.
    *   Update `Docs/DevLog.md` to summarize this session's accomplishments, decisions, and any issues.
    *   Prepare `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` for the next session.

## 4. Important Pointers & Reminders

*   **Key Architectural Overview:** [Docs/Architecture.md](./Architecture.md)
*   **Detailed Daily Log:** [Docs/DevLog.md](./DevLog.md)
*   **Task Management:** Primary task tracking is done in this document (`DailyBriefing.md` for daily tasks) and in `Docs/Roadmap.md` (for long-term goals).
*   **Code Style & Contribution:** See `README.md` and `Docs/CodeStyle.md` (if it exists).
*   **User Preferences:** Documentation should be emoji-free, accessible, use "Automated Doc Refresher." (Memory ID: 5de9c30b-ac36-48df-ba4c-13a7f5034109)
