## 3. ðŸ”¥ Key Tasks for This Session (for LLM/Programmer) ðŸ”¥

*   **Primary Objective:** Finalize and commit all documentation changes related to the new multi-session daily handoff system. Then, proceed with the "Daily Finish" routine for the current work block.
*   **Task 1:** Resolve outstanding Git issues and commit the following files with the message "docs: adapt handoff system for multi-session days":
    *   `README.md` (updated ADR description - if not already committed)
    *   `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` (this file - populated and restructured for multi-session support)
    *   `Docs/MetaPrompts/DailyStart_LLMPrompt.md` (created - if not already committed)
    *   `Docs/MetaPrompts/DailyFinish_LLMPrompt.md` (updated for multi-session support)
    *   *Context/Details:* Consider using GitHub Desktop if CLI `git add` continues to fail.
*   **Task 2:** Once committed, guide the user (Cole) through the "Daily Finish" procedure using the updated `Docs/MetaPrompts/DailyFinish_LLMPrompt.md`. This will involve:
    *   Updating `Docs/DevLog.md` for the work completed in *this* session (e.g., structuring for multi-session handoffs).
    *   Preparing `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` for the *next* session (or end of day).
    *   Discussing branch status and next steps.
    *   Committing these final documentation updates.
