# Daily Briefing - HorizonFrame

**Session Start:** 2025-05-25 09:00

---

## 1. Overall Project Goal & Current Focus

*   **Project Goal:** To build a daily alignment journal that helps users live more intentionally by reflecting on their personal code and insights.
*   **Current Sprint/Phase Goal:** With the enhanced documentation and handoff system in place, the current focus is to implement UI refinements on the Align, Collect, and Settings pages.

## 2. Status from Previous Session (2025-05-24, Session 2, approx. 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM)

*   **Key Accomplishments:**
    *   Refined the daily handoff document system (`DailyBriefing.md`, `DailyStart_LLMPrompt.md`, `DailyFinish_LLMPrompt.md`) to support multiple LLM work sessions per day.
    *   Updated `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` structure for timestamped sessions and `Docs/MetaPrompts/DailyFinish_LLMPrompt.md` for session-specific guidance.
    *   Clarified user (Cole) workflow for using `MetaPrompt` scripts at session start/end.
    *   Executed the "Daily Finish" routine: updated `Docs/DevLog.md` for this session and prepared this `DailyBriefing.md` for the next session (2025-05-25).
*   **Link to detailed DevLog entry:** [Docs/DevLog.md#2025-05-24---session-2-approx-1100-am---1200-pm](./DevLog.md#2025-05-24---session-2-approx-1100-am---1200-pm) (Ensure DevLog heading matches for linking)
*   **Decisions Made:**
    *   Adopted multi-session support for handoff documents.
    *   User will use `MetaPrompt` scripts for LLM interaction at session boundaries.
*   **Outstanding Issues/Blockers:**
    *   **Critical:** Confirmation needed that all documentation changes (initial handoff system files AND multi-session adaptations) were successfully committed to Git. The commit message for multi-session changes should be `"docs: adapt handoff system for multi-session days"`. Files potentially affected by CLI staging issues: `README.md`, initial `Docs/DailyBriefing.md`, `Docs/MetaPrompts/DailyStart_LLMPrompt.md`.
    *   The `Docs/DevLog.md` and the current `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` (this file, as prepared at end of 2025-05-24 S2) also need to be committed.

## 3. ðŸ”¥ Key Tasks for This Session (2025-05-25 09:00) (for LLM/Programmer) ðŸ”¥

*   **Primary Objective:** Verify all prior documentation work is committed and pushed, then implement UI refinements for the Align, Collect, and Settings pages.
*   **Task 1 (Git Workflow Verification - Carried Over):**
    *   Verify with Cole that all recent documentation changes (as listed in the previous briefing and session logs) are committed. This includes:
        1.  Initial handoff system files (`README.md`, `DailyBriefing.md` v1, `DailyStart_LLMPrompt.md`, `DailyFinish_LLMPrompt.md` v1).
        2.  Multi-session adaptation files (`DailyBriefing.md` v2, `DailyFinish_LLMPrompt.md` v2 - ideally committed with message `"docs: adapt handoff system for multi-session days"`).
        3.  The `Docs/DevLog.md` entry for 2025-05-24 Session 2.
        4.  This `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` file (as prepared for 2025-05-25).
    *   If all are confirmed as committed, ensure they have been pushed to `origin/main` using GitHub Desktop.
*   **Task 2 (UI - Align Page):**
    *   Implement functionality for the 3-dots menu to allow editing of personal code statements.
*   **Task 3 (UI - Collect Page Styling):**
    *   Ensure the background of personal code line boxes is black, matching the screen background.
    *   Apply the same black background styling to insight collection elements if the issue is present there.
    *   Change the "Deposit" button color from blue to white.
*   **Task 4 (UI - Settings Page Styling):**
    *   Ensure the page background is consistently black.
*   **Task 5 (Session Wrap-up):**
    *   Commit all new code and documentation changes made during this session using GitHub Desktop.
    *   Push these changes to `origin/main` using GitHub Desktop.
    *   Update `Docs/DevLog.md` to summarize this session's accomplishments, decisions, and any issues.
    *   Prepare `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` for the next session.
