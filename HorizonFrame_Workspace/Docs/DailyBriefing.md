# Daily Briefing - HorizonFrame

**Session Start:** 2025-05-25 09:00

## 1. Overall Project Goal & Current Focus

*   **Project Goal:** To build a daily alignment journal that helps users live more intentionally by reflecting on their personal code and insights.
*   **Current Sprint/Phase Goal:** With the UI refinements for Align, Collect, and Settings pages completed, the next focus is to implement core functionalities, starting with editing personal code in the Align view.

## 2. Status from Previous Session (2025-05-24, Session 3)

*   **Key Accomplishments:**
    *   Systematically attempted several common SwiftUI fixes for swipe action issues in `AlignView` (ensuring `ScrollView`, simplifying `ForEach`, trying `LazyVStack`, commenting out other gestures).
    *   Created `Docs/MetaPrompts/EndOfDayProcedure_LLMPrompt.md` to standardize end-of-session documentation updates.
    *   Updated `Docs/Roadmap.md` and `Docs/DevLog.md` to reflect the current status.
*   **Link to detailed DevLog entry:** [Docs/DevLog.md#2025-05-24---session-3-approx-1600---1645](./DevLog.md#2025-05-24---session-3-approx-1600---1645)
*   **Decisions Made:**
    *   Paused swipe action debugging in the macOS simulator due to persistent issues.
*   **Outstanding Issues/Blockers:**
    *   **Critical:** Swipe actions in `AlignView.swift` remain non-functional in the macOS simulator. The root cause is still undetermined despite multiple attempts. This blocks the implementation of swipe-to-edit/delete functionality.

## 3. ðŸ”¥ Key Tasks for This Session (2025-05-25 09:00) (for LLM/Programmer) ðŸ”¥

*   **Primary Objective:** Resolve the `AlignView.swift` swipe action issue or decide on an alternative interaction for edit/delete.
*   **Task 1 (AlignView Swipe Actions - Investigation):**
    *   **Option A (Recommended First Step):** Test the current `AlignView.swift` implementation (with `ScrollView` and `LazyVStack`) on a physical iOS device. This will help determine if the issue is simulator-specific.
    *   **Option B (If Device Testing Fails or is Not Possible):**
        *   Revisit `AlignView.swift`. Consider temporarily replacing `ScrollView { LazyVStack { ForEach ... } }` with a standard SwiftUI `List { ForEach ... } .onDelete { ... } .swipeActions { ... }` to see if basic `List`-based swipes work. This is for diagnostic purposes to isolate the issue further.
        *   Research any known SwiftUI swipe action bugs or specific considerations for macOS Catalyst if the app is intended for macOS (though current focus seems iOS).
*   **Task 2 (AlignView - Alternative Interaction - If Swipes Remain Blocked):**
    *   If swipe actions cannot be made functional quickly, discuss and begin implementing an alternative mechanism for editing and deleting personal code statements in `AlignView`. Examples:
        *   Long-press context menu on each item.
        *   Visible edit/delete buttons next to each item (perhaps appearing on selection or hover if on macOS).
        *   Utilizing the existing 3-dot menu more directly for per-item actions if an item can be marked as 'active' or 'selected'.
*   **Task 3 (Documentation & Planning):**
    *   Based on the outcome of Task 1 & 2, update `Docs/Roadmap.md` regarding the approach for `AlignView` edit/delete actions.
    *   If a new approach is chosen, outline sub-tasks for its implementation.
*   **Task 4 (Session Wrap-up):**
    *   Commit all new code and documentation changes made during this session using GitHub Desktop.
    *   Push these changes to `origin/main` using GitHub Desktop.
    *   Update `Docs/DevLog.md` to summarize this session's accomplishments, decisions, and any issues.
    *   Prepare `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` for the next session.

## 4. Important Pointers & Reminders

*   **Key Architectural Overview:** [Docs/Architecture.md](./Architecture.md)
*   **Detailed Daily Log:** [Docs/DevLog.md](./DevLog.md)
*   **Task Management:** Primary task tracking is done in this document (`DailyBriefing.md` for daily tasks) and in `Docs/Roadmap.md` (for long-term goals).
*   **Code Style & Contribution:** See `README.md` and `Docs/CodeStyle.md` (if it exists).
*   **User Preferences:** Documentation should be emoji-free, accessible, use "Automated Doc Refresher." (Memory ID: 5de9c30b-ac36-48df-ba4c-13a7f5034109)

## 5. For the User (Cole): Quick Re-entry Notes

*   **Last thing we did (2025-05-24, Session 3):** Attempted to debug `AlignView.swift` swipe actions (unsuccessful in simulator). Created `EndOfDayProcedure_LLMPrompt.md`. Updated `DevLog.md`, `Roadmap.md`, and this `DailyBriefing.md`.
*   **Focus for next personal session/next LLM session (2025-05-25 09:00):** Resolve `AlignView` swipe action issue (try on device) or implement alternative edit/delete interaction.
*   **Mental State/Energy Level:** (User to fill at start of next session)
*   **Quick Reminders/Todos:** (User to fill at start of next session)
