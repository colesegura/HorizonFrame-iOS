# Daily Briefing - HorizonFrame

**Session Start:** 2025-05-25 09:00

---

## 1. Overall Project Goal & Current Focus

*   **Project Goal:** To build a daily alignment journal that helps users live more intentionally by reflecting on their personal code and insights.
*   **Current Sprint/Phase Goal:** With the enhanced documentation and handoff system in place, the current focus is to resume active development on HorizonFrame features, starting with [Next chosen feature/task - TBD at start of 05-25 session].

## 2. Status from Previous Session (2025-05-24, Session 2, approx. 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM)

*   **Key Accomplishments:**
    *   Refined the daily handoff document system (`DailyBriefing.md`, `DailyStart_LLMPrompt.md`, `DailyFinish_LLMPrompt.md`) to support multiple LLM work sessions per day.
    *   Updated `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` structure for timestamped sessions and `Docs/MetaPrompts/DailyFinish_LLMPrompt.md` for session-specific guidance.
    *   Clarified user (Cole) workflow for using `MetaPrompt` scripts at session start/end.
    *   Executed the "Daily Finish" routine: updated `Docs/DevLog.md` for this session and prepared this `DailyBriefing.md` for the next session (2025-05-25).
*   **Link to detailed DevLog entry:** [Docs/DevLog.md#2025-05-24---session-2-approx-1100-am---1200-pm](./DevLog.md#2025-05-24---session-2-approx-1100-am---1200-pm) (Ensure DevLog heading matches for linking)
*   **Decisions Made:**
    *   Adopted multi-session support for handoff documents.
    *   User will use `MetaPrompt` scripts for LLM interaction at session boundaries.
*   **Outstanding Issues/Blockers:**
    *   **Critical:** Confirmation needed that all documentation changes (initial handoff system files AND multi-session adaptations) were successfully committed to Git. The commit message for multi-session changes should be `"docs: adapt handoff system for multi-session days"`. Files potentially affected by CLI staging issues: `README.md`, initial `Docs/DailyBriefing.md`, `Docs/MetaPrompts/DailyStart_LLMPrompt.md`.
    *   The `Docs/DevLog.md` and the current `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` (this file, as prepared at end of 2025-05-24 S2) also need to be committed.
