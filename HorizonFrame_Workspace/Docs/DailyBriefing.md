# Daily Briefing - NeuroPaths

**Session Start:** 2025-05-28 09:00 (To be confirmed by user)

---

## 1. Overall Project Goal & Current Focus

*   **Project Goal:** To develop "NeuroPaths," an app that helps users understand and rewire their emotional responses by guiding them through an "emotional circuit completion" practice, visualized as a growing "Neural Constellation."
*   **Current Sprint/Phase Goal:** Begin development of the NeuroPaths MVP (v0.1.0) as outlined in the [Docs/Roadmap.md#neuropaths---neural-constellation-roadmap-v01---initial-concept](./Roadmap.md#neuropaths---neural-constellation-roadmap-v01---initial-concept). The immediate focus is on Sprint 1: Core Emotion Logging & Basic Circuit.

## 2. Status from Previous Session (2025-05-27)

*   **Key Accomplishments:**
    *   **Major Pivot:** Successfully pivoted the project from "HorizonFrame" to "NeuroPaths - Neural Constellation."
    *   **Documentation Overhaul:**
        *   Updated `README.md` with the new app name, tagline, and concept.
        *   Updated `Docs/DevLog.md` with a detailed entry for 2025-05-27, documenting the pivot and all changes. (Assumed link: `[Docs/DevLog.md#2025-05-27---major-pivot-to-neuropaths--documentation-overhaul](./DevLog.md#2025-05-27---major-pivot-to-neuropaths--documentation-overhaul)`)
        *   Updated `Docs/Architecture.md` with the new NeuroPaths architecture and archived the old HorizonFrame architecture.
        *   Updated `Docs/UI_Theme_Exploration.md` to reflect the "Neural Constellation" theme.
        *   Updated `Docs/Roadmap.md` with a new roadmap for NeuroPaths MVP and archived the old roadmap.
        *   Updated `Docs/MarketingStrategy.md` to align with NeuroPaths and archived the old strategy.
        *   Created/Updated `Docs/Decisions.md` with the decision log for the pivot.
    *   Prepared this `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` for the next session.
*   **Link to detailed DevLog entry:** Please verify the exact link in `Docs/DevLog.md` for the 2025-05-27 entry.
*   **Decisions Made:**
    *   Pivoted project to "NeuroPaths - Neural Constellation."
    *   Archived all previous HorizonFrame documentation within the relevant files.
*   **Outstanding Issues/Blockers:**
    *   None directly from today's documentation work. Focus shifts to new development.

## 3. ðŸ”¥ Key Tasks for This Session (2025-05-28) (for LLM/Programmer) ðŸ”¥

*   **Primary Objective:** Begin implementation of the NeuroPaths MVP (v0.1.0) - Sprint 1: Core Emotion Logging & Basic Circuit.
*   **Task 1 (Project Setup & Initial Models - if needed):**
    *   Review the existing project structure. Determine if any significant refactoring or new project setup is needed for NeuroPaths (e.g., renaming targets, core data model changes).
    *   Define initial Swift data models for `EmotionalEntry`, `CompletedCircuit` as per `Docs/Architecture.md`.
*   **Task 2 (Emotion Selection/Input UI):**
    *   Design and implement the initial UI for users to select or input their current emotion. Refer to `Docs/UI_Theme_Exploration.md` for visual guidelines.
    *   Consider how emotions will be categorized or selected (e.g., list, wheel, free text with suggestions).
*   **Task 3 (Basic Circuit Guidance - Placeholder):**
    *   Outline the initial steps for the "emotional circuit completion" practice.
    *   Implement a placeholder UI flow for this guidance. Detailed content and logic can be iterated upon.
*   **Task 4 (Data Persistence - Initial):**
    *   Implement basic saving of `EmotionalEntry` data (e.g., using SwiftData or CoreData).
*   **Task 5 (Documentation & Planning):**
    *   Document any new data structures or UI components.
    *   Update `Docs/Roadmap.md` with progress on Sprint 1 tasks.
*   **Task 6 (Session Wrap-up):**
    *   Commit all new code and documentation changes.
    *   Update `Docs/DevLog.md`.
    *   Prepare `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` for the next session.

## 4. Important Pointers & Reminders

*   **Key Architectural Overview (NeuroPaths):** [Docs/Architecture.md#neuropaths-architecture-version-01---initial-concept](./Architecture.md#neuropaths-architecture-version-01---initial-concept)
*   **NeuroPaths Roadmap:** [Docs/Roadmap.md#neuropaths---neural-constellation-roadmap-v01---initial-concept](./Roadmap.md#neuropaths---neural-constellation-roadmap-v01---initial-concept)
*   **UI Theme Guide:** [Docs/UI_Theme_Exploration.md](./UI_Theme_Exploration.md)
*   **Detailed Daily Log:** [Docs/DevLog.md](./DevLog.md)
*   **User Preferences (from previous project context - VERIFY RELEVANCE):** Documentation should be emoji-free, accessible, use "Automated Doc Refresher." (Memory ID: 5de9c30b-ac36-48df-ba4c-13a7f5034109) - *Consider if a new memory for NeuroPaths context is needed.*
