# Daily Finish Instructions for LLM Assistant (HorizonFrame Project)

Excellent work this session! To wrap up and prepare for the next one, please assist with the following documentation updates. This is part of our "Automated Doc Refresher" process as outlined in `Docs/WorkflowGuide.md`.

1.  **Collaborate on `Docs/DevLog.md` Entry:**
    *   Prompt the USER for a summary of "Key Tasks Worked On" during *this session*.
    *   Prompt the USER for "Accomplishments" achieved in *this session*.
    *   Prompt the USER for any "Key Decisions Made" during *this session*.
    *   Prompt the USER for any "Issues Encountered" during *this session*.
    *   Prompt the USER for "Next Steps (for next session)" based on the outcome of *this session* and the `Docs/Roadmap.md`.
    *   Assist in drafting the new entry. Ensure it follows the established format. If an entry for today (YYYY-MM-DD) already exists, append to it or create a new sub-entry if appropriate (e.g., if it was a distinct work block).

2.  **Assist in Updating `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` (for the *Next* Session):**
    *   **Session Start Time:** Remind the USER to update the anticipated start date and time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM) for the *next* session.
    *   **Section: Summary of Last Session:**
        *   Help the USER summarize *this just-completed session's* key accomplishments, decisions, and any unresolved issues.
        *   Ensure it notes the end time or a reference to *this session*.
        *   Suggest linking to the newly created `Docs/DevLog.md` entry for *this session*.
    *   **Section: Key Tasks for This Session (i.e., for the *Next* Session):**
        *   This is crucial. Prompt the USER to define specific, actionable tasks for the *next* development session. These tasks should align with `Docs/Roadmap.md` or emergent needs.
    *   **Section: For the User (e.g., Cole's Notes):**
        *   If this section exists, prompt the USER to update any personal notes, such as "Last thing we did (this session)" and "Focus for next personal session/next LLM session."
    *   Remind the USER to ensure all other sections of `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` are reviewed and still relevant for the *next* session's context.

3.  **Review Git Status & Next Objective:**
    *   Prompt the USER to consider the status of the current Git branch: Is the work from *this session* complete and ready for a commit (and potential Pull Request), or will work continue on this branch in the next session?
    *   Briefly confirm with the USER that the primary objective for the *next* session is clearly captured in the updated `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` (under "Key Tasks").

4.  **Remind to Commit Changes:**
    *   Once all documentation is updated and next steps are clear, remind the USER to commit `Docs/DevLog.md`, `Docs/DailyBriefing.md`, the updated `README.md`, `Docs/WorkflowGuide.md`, and any other changed project files to Git.
    *   If helpful, offer to suggest a comprehensive commit message (e.g., "docs: conclude session YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM, update project documentation").

Thank you for your assistance in maintaining our project's context and ensuring smooth handoffs!
