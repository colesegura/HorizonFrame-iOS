# Daily Briefing - HorizonFrame

**Session Start:** 2025-06-13

---

## 1. Overall Project Goal & Current Focus

*   **Project Goal:** To develop "HorizonFrame," an app that helps users stay grounded in what they believe in by aligning themselves daily with chosen passages or personal statements. The app aims to facilitate a meditative practice and reinforce these alignments through features like wallpaper creation and community sharing.
*   **Current Sprint/Phase Goal:** Enhance core UI/UX with a custom animated tab bar and consistent global gradient background. Resolve any outstanding build issues. Continue with documentation updates and feature development as per the roadmap.

## 2. Status from Previous Session (2025-06-12)

*   **Key Accomplishments:**
    *   **AlignPassageView UI Revamp & Video Export Complete:** Successfully revamped `AlignPassageView` with interactive line-by-line progression and integrated the animated video export feature.
        *   Created `PassageVideoGenerator.swift` service for video compositing and encoding.
        *   Created `PassageTextRendererView.swift` for consistent text rendering in videos.
        *   Updated `AlignPassageView.swift` for video generation state management, UI feedback, and share sheet presentation.
        *   Modified `AlignView.swift` to pass `videoName` to `AlignPassageView`.
    *   **Documentation Updated:**
        *   `Docs/Roadmap.md`: Marked passage view revamp and video export features as complete.
        *   `Docs/DevLog.md`: Added a detailed entry for the 2025-06-12 session.
        *   `Docs/Architecture.md`: Added descriptions for `PassageVideoGenerator` and `PassageTextRendererView`.
*   **Key Decisions Made:**
    *   Encapsulated video generation logic in `PassageVideoGenerator` service.
    *   Utilized a dedicated `PassageTextRendererView` for consistent video text overlays.
    *   Managed video export UI state locally within `AlignPassageView`.
*   **Issues Encountered/Pending (Resolved):**
    *   Initial `replace_file_content` inaccuracies for `AlignPassageView.swift` were resolved by careful full-content replacement.
    *   Misidentification of the `Docs` directory path (was `Documentation`) was corrected, restoring access to documentation files.

## 3. ðŸ”¥ Key Tasks for This Session (2025-06-13) ðŸ”¥

*   **Primary Objective:** Thoroughly test the newly implemented Passage View Revamp and Video Export features, finalize documentation, and complete the GitHub workflow for the `feature/passage-view-revamp` branch.

*   **Task 1: Testing & Validation:**
    *   **Video Export:** Test video generation in `AlignPassageView` with various passages and video backgrounds (ensure `HF_Vid_Waves_01.mp4` and other test videos are bundled).
        *   Verify correct text animation, timing, and visual appearance.
        *   Test progress indicator functionality.
        *   Test error handling (e.g., missing video file, invalid passage data).
        *   Test share sheet presentation and actual sharing of the video file.
        *   Verify temporary video file cleanup after sharing/dismissal.
    *   **UI & Interaction:**
        *   Test line-by-line progression in `AlignPassageView`.
        *   Verify UI consistency (transparent nav bar, text over darkened video) in `PassageDetailView` and `AlignPassageView`.
        *   Test navigation to and from these views.
    *   **General:** Check for any crashes, UI glitches, or performance issues on a simulator and, if possible, a physical device.

*   **Task 2: Final Documentation Review:**
    *   Briefly review `Docs/Roadmap.md`, `Docs/DevLog.md` (2025-06-12 entry), `Docs/Architecture.md`, and this `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` for accuracy and completeness.

*   **Task 3: GitHub Workflow:**
    *   Commit all code changes (Swift files) and documentation updates (`.md` files) to the `feature/passage-view-revamp` branch with a comprehensive commit message.
    *   Guide the USER on pushing the `feature/passage-view-revamp` branch to the remote repository.
    *   Guide the USER on creating a Pull Request (PR) to merge `feature/passage-view-revamp` into the main development branch (e.g., `develop` or `main`). Include a summary of changes in the PR description.
