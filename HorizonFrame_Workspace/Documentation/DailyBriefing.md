# Daily Briefing - HorizonFrame

**Session Start:** 2025-06-12 (To be filled by USER)

---

## 1. Overall Project Goal & Current Focus

*   **Project Goal:** To develop "HorizonFrame," an app that helps users stay grounded in what they believe in by aligning themselves daily with chosen passages or personal statements. The app aims to facilitate a meditative practice and reinforce these alignments through features like wallpaper creation and community sharing.
*   **Current Sprint/Phase Goal:** Enhance core UI/UX with a custom animated tab bar and consistent global gradient background. Resolve any outstanding build issues. Continue with documentation updates and feature development as per the roadmap.

## 2. Status from Previous Session (2025-06-11)

*   **Key Accomplishments:**
    *   **`CollectView` Refactor Complete:** Successfully refactored `CollectView` to be passage-focused. This included:
        *   Updating the `Passage` model (`Passage.swift`) with `isActive` and `tags` properties.
        *   Overhauling `CollectViewModel.swift` for passage management (add, delete, toggle active state).
        *   Rebuilding `CollectView.swift` with "Active"/"Added" sections, `PassageRowView`, swipe-to-delete, and a new `AddPassageView` sheet (for title, content, author, category, tags).
        *   Styling the add button ("+") in `CollectView` to white.
    *   **`DummyData.swift` Updated:** Aligned sample passages in `Utilities/DummyData.swift` with the new `Passage` model structure, including `isActive` and `tags`.
    *   **Documentation Updated:**
        *   `Docs/Roadmap.md`: Marked the `CollectView` feature as complete.
        *   `Docs/Architecture.md`: Updated the `CollectView` description to reflect the new passage-centric architecture.
*   **Key Decisions Made:**
    *   Adopted direct passage management for `CollectView`, moving away from a collection-based model.
    *   Confirmed `Docs/WorkflowGuide.md` remains current and requires no changes for this development cycle.
*   **Issues Encountered/Pending:**
    *   Noted minor inaccuracies with `replace_file_content` tool's `TargetContent` matching for documentation updates, though the tool successfully applied the intended changes.

## 3. ðŸ”¥ Key Tasks for This Session (2025-06-12) ðŸ”¥

*   **Primary Objective:** Thoroughly test the refactored `CollectView`, ensure UI/UX quality, and plan the next development cycle.
*   **Task 1 (CollectView Testing - CRITICAL):**
    *   **Action:** Run the app on a simulator or device.
    *   **Goal:** Test all aspects of `CollectView`:
        *   Adding new passages with all fields (text, author, category, tags).
        *   Correct display of passages in "Active" and "Added" sections.
        *   Toggling the "isActive" state of passages (star button) and verifying they move between sections.
        *   Deleting passages using swipe-to-delete from both sections.
        *   Verify the "+" button appearance and functionality.
        *   Check UI for different passage lengths and content, ensuring no layout issues.
*   **Task 2 (Roadmap Review & Next Feature Planning):**
    *   Review `Docs/Roadmap.md` for remaining tasks in the current sprint or for v0.2.0.
    *   Discuss and select the next UI feature or development task for HorizonFrame. Consider areas like "AlignView Improvements" (e.g., personal code editing) or "Progress Tab Enhancements."
*   **Task 3 (Code Review & Refinement - Optional):**
    *   Briefly review the newly added/modified Swift files (`Passage.swift`, `CollectViewModel.swift`, `CollectView.swift`, `DummyData.swift`) for any obvious improvements or adherence to `CodeStyle.md` (if available).
*   **Task 4 (Session Wrap-up):**
    *   Commit all new code and documentation changes (if any from this session).
    *   Update `Docs/DevLog.md` for today's session.
    *   Prepare `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` for the next session.
