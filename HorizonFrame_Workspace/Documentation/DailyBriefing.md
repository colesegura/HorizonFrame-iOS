# Daily Briefing - HorizonFrame

**Session Start:** 2025-06-06 (To be filled by USER)

---

## 1. Overall Project Goal & Current Focus

*   **Project Goal:** To develop "HorizonFrame," an app that helps users stay grounded in what they believe in by aligning themselves daily with chosen passages or personal statements. The app aims to facilitate a meditative practice and reinforce these alignments through features like wallpaper creation and community sharing.
*   **Current Sprint/Phase Goal:** Enhance core UI/UX with a custom animated tab bar and consistent global gradient background. Resolve any outstanding build issues. Continue with documentation updates and feature development as per the roadmap.

## 2. Status from Previous Session (2025-06-05)

*   **Key Accomplishments:**
    *   **Custom Animated Tab Bar:** Successfully implemented a custom animated expanding/collapsing tab bar (`CustomTabBarView`, `MainAppView`) to replace the standard `TabView`. The new tab bar is text-only and features a kinetic frame around the selected tab.
    *   **Global Animated Gradient Background:** Refined the `AnimatedGradientBackground` to be darker and animate more slowly. Ensured this gradient is visible across all main tab views (`AlignView`, `CollectView`, `ExploreView`, `SettingsView`) by making their respective backgrounds transparent.
    *   **UI Consistency:** Addressed various UI elements (local gradients, opaque view backgrounds) that were obscuring the global gradient.
    *   **Documentation:** Updated `Docs/DevLog.md` with the session's activities. Began updates to `Docs/Architecture.md`.
*   **Key Decisions Made:**
    *   `MainAppView` now orchestrates the main UI with `CustomTabBarView`.
    *   `AppTab.swift` defines tab metadata.
    *   Individual views (`AlignView`, `CollectView`, etc.) modified for background transparency.
*   **Issues Encountered/Pending:**
    *   **Critical Build Error Risk:** Potential "Cannot find type 'AppTab' in scope" errors if `Models/AppTab.swift` lacks correct Target Membership in Xcode. USER advised to verify and fix.
    *   Minor UI/animation adjustments might still be needed after thorough testing.

## 3. ðŸ”¥ Key Tasks for This Session (2025-06-06) ðŸ”¥

*   **Primary Objective:** Verify UI stability, complete documentation updates, and prepare for next feature development cycle.
*   **Task 1 (Build & UI Verification - CRITICAL):**
    *   **Action:** In Xcode, ensure `Models/AppTab.swift` is included in the "Horizon-Frame" target's "Compile Sources" build phase and has Target Membership checked for "Horizon-Frame".
    *   **Action:** Clean build folder (Shift+Cmd+K) and rebuild the project (Cmd+B).
    *   **Goal:** Confirm there are NO "Cannot find type 'AppTab' in scope" errors or other build-time issues.
    *   **Action:** Run the app on a simulator or device. Thoroughly test the new custom tab bar (expansion, collapse, tab selection) and verify the animated gradient background is visible and correct on all main views (`Align`, `Collect`, `Explore`, `Settings`).
*   **Task 2 (Documentation - Finalize Updates):**
    *   Complete updates to `Docs/Architecture.md` (if anything pending from previous session).
    *   Review and update `Docs/WorkflowGuide.md` to ensure it reflects current project state and processes, especially regarding UI component creation or modification if relevant.
*   **Task 3 (Roadmap Review & Next Feature Planning):**
    *   Review `Docs/Roadmap.md`.
    *   Discuss and select the next UI feature or development task for HorizonFrame.
*   **Task 4 (Session Wrap-up):**
    *   Commit all new code and documentation changes.
    *   Update `Docs/DevLog.md` for today's session.
    *   Prepare `Docs/DailyBriefing.md` for the next session.

## 5. For the User (Cole): Quick Re-entry Notes

*   **Last thing we did (2025-06-05):** Implemented the custom animated tab bar, refined the global gradient background, ensured gradient visibility across all main views, and updated `DevLog.md` and `Architecture.md`.
*   **Focus for this session (2025-06-06):** CRITICAL: Verify `AppTab.swift` target membership to resolve build errors. Test the new UI thoroughly. Finalize documentation updates (`Architecture.md`, `WorkflowGuide.md`). Plan next development steps from `Roadmap.md`.
*   **Mental State/Energy Level:** (User to fill)
*   **Quick Reminders/Todos:** (User to fill)
    *   Remember to check Xcode Target Membership for `AppTab.swift`!
